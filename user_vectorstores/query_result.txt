Result: Durkheim's work on religion, particularly his analysis of totemism, can be exemplified by his concept of a sacred force that is impersonal and diffuse, present in all beings but not confined to any single one. This force, according to Durkheim, is worshipped by believers who feel a certain way of acting imposed upon them by the nature of this sacred principle. This idea can be seen in how individuals in a society feel a perpetual dependence on the collective force, similar to how believers in totemism feel bound by the sacred force they worship.

On the other hand, Bourdieu's approach to philosophy can be illustrated by his critique of the philosophical institution as a machine that decontextualizes knowledge. By emphasizing the need to recontextualize philosophical content and to reveal the underlying forces at play within the institution, Bourdieu's work can be seen as a radicalization of philosophical inquiry. This can be exemplified by his engagement with thinkers like Wittgenstein and Pascal, who questioned the traditional role of philosophy and emphasized the need to dispel illusions perpetuated by philosophical traditions.
