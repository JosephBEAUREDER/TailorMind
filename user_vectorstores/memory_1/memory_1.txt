This force, according to Durkheim, is worshipped by believers who feel a certain way of acting imposed upon them by the nature of this sacred principle. This idea can be seen in how individuals in a society feel a perpetual dependence on the collective force, similar to how believers in totemism feel bound by the sacred force they worship.\n\nOn the other hand, Bourdieu's approach to philosophy can be illustrated by his critique of the philosophical institution as a machine that decontextualizes knowledge. By emphasizing the need to recontextualize philosophical content and to reveal the underlying forces at play within the institution, Bourdieu's work can be seen as a radicalization of philosophical inquiry. This can be exemplified by his engagement with thinkers like Wittgenstein and Pascal, who questioned the traditional role of philosophy and emphasized the need to dispel illusions perpetuated by philosophical traditions."}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Thank you for sharing those examples from your notes! It seems like you appreciate in-depth analyses and comparisons between different theorists and their perspectives. Exploring the connections and contrasts between Durkheim's and Bourdieu's approaches to philosophy and religion can provide valuable insights into how different thinkers tackle similar concepts. \n\nWould you like to delve deeper into these examples or explore similar comparisons in other areas of study?"}]
